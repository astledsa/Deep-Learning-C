# Deep-Learning-C

This is a simple deep learning framework based on the Pytorch library. In this repo, I have implemented:

- The Tensor data structure
- An autograd engine 
- Layer and Model abstractions
- Data Parallelism 
- A Transformer Layer

from scratch in C. The purpose was to learn the engineering difficulties and to explore parallelism in such frameworks.
